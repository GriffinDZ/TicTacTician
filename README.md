# TicTacTician
Small game made in my freshman year of college. 

For the graphics, utilizes the Java Swing library. The logic is also coded in Java. 
Created because my friends and I were tired of having to draw up a whole new board every time we wanted to play Tic-Tac-Tacian. 

Uses Java because it was the only coding language I knew at the time. 
The actual code files have been lost to time, but the jar should still be able to be downloaded and executed. 

I do not plan on updating this project- If I was going to continue working on something related to Tic-Tac-Tician, I would use a different language.
